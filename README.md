**Admin Dashboard**

i created this simple admin dashboard which has:
-Dashboard session : i use useContext to track how many users, products, and customers in the dahsboaord
-User session : we can add and i put the swal/notification popup effect, and we can filter the user based on the name, role
-Products session: almost the same as user session but the filter is based on price and name
-Customer session: Basically the same as user
-Calender page

I use react, tailwindcss to make this simple admin dashboard
